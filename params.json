Our purpose of this app is to show all players of bullying what bullying can do, the cost of it, and finding other options in life instead of bullying. The app is a path following game with you as the bully and have choices of what to do to your victim and what will happen in the end: suicide, or genocide. Our team is trying to show a message that bullying could end up killing people along with themselves, unless you, the viewer, will pledge to stand up against bullies and bullies to give up being bullies. We will also have a secondary route that shows ways to no longer be a bully, and maybe show you how a bully become a bully.\r\n\r\nI  searched about bullies and found: A study from a group called Fight Crime: Invest in Kids concluded that nearly 60 percent of boys whom researchers classified as bullies in grades 6-9 were convicted of at least one crime by the age of 24. And get this, 40 percent of those same boys grew up to have three or more criminal convictions. In other words, today's bully could be tomorrow's criminal.\r\nFrom “Today Bullies - Tomorrow Criminals” by Diane Diamond\r\n\r\nI then searched for any suicides and murders connected to Bullying and found plenty of news and stories.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Suicide Awareness Voices for Education suicides among 15-24 years olds is the third leading cause of death for youth. One of 65,000 children ages 10 to 14 commit suicide every year. Over 16% of students seriously consider suicide, 13% create a plan, and 8 percent have made a serious attempt. It results in about 4,400 deaths per year.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is a choose your direction path to see how the end goes.\r\n\r\nWe are hoping to have this app available for all platforms, even the 1st IPod Touch.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
